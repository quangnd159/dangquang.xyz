I took the test in 2014 (2nd time) at IDP and got 8.0 overall (L8, R8, W7, S8.5).</p><a href=#preparation><h2 id=preparation>Preparation</h2></a><p>This time I had 20 days to prepare for the test. I did 3 listening tests online (scores ranging from 7-9) and 1-2 reading tests (8-9). Almost no prep for speaking though I did talk to myself a lot (as usual). However, I did tons of reading for the writing part: reading and analyzing high-level essays (I learned quite a lot from this.)</p><a href=#the-test><h2 id=the-test>The test</h2></a><ul><li><strong>Test date</strong>: 22 May 2022</li><li><strong>Location</strong>: British Council (Viettel Complex Building 285 CMT8)</li><li><strong>Mode</strong>: Computer-Delivered 🖥</li></ul><a href=#listening><h3 id=listening>Listening</h3></a><p>I got a little distracted in Part 2 and Part 3 where there are multiple choice and matching questions. IELTS Listening is funny. You zone out for a second and boom! you&rsquo;ve missed an answer. This happened to me because the first two answers of the question set are put too close to one another in the recording.</p><p>It&rsquo;s important to stay calm even when you&rsquo;ve missed an answer and pay attention on the next signpost. Losing one answer is fine. You can go back to it at the end of that section to make an educated guess.</p><ul><li><strong>Part 1</strong>: Conversation between two friends about a job vacancy (waiter) at a restaurant</li><li><strong>Part 2</strong>: Radio talk about Lakeview Orchestra and its new program</li><li><strong>Part 3</strong>: Conversation between two students about their presentation on mercury contamination</li><li><strong>Part 4</strong>: A lecture of human perception of smell</li><li><strong>My performance</strong>: OK (missed one answer in Part 2 and had to guess based on what I thought I hadn’t heard) and 2 other answers I’m not 100% certain.</li><li><strong>Predicted score</strong>: 8.0-8.5 (if I&rsquo;m lucky)</li></ul><a href=#reading><h3 id=reading>Reading</h3></a><p>I think I nailed this one. Not very hard. No matching headings. The highlighting function is definitely helpful. For reading, it&rsquo;s important that we know which question types follow the same order as the information in the text. That helps a lot. Probably one of the reasons why I could complete the test 13 minutes early.</p><ul><li><strong>Passage 1</strong>: Curran Judith - Documentary Film Maker</li><li><strong>Passage 2</strong>: Being left-handed in a right-handed world</li><li><strong>Passage 3</strong>: Honeybees in trouble - can native bees fill the gap?</li><li><strong>My performance</strong>: Good (had 13 minutes left to review every answer)</li><li><strong>Predicted score</strong>: 9.0</li></ul><a href=#writing><h3 id=writing>Writing</h3></a><p>I completed both tasks in 45 minutes and had 15 minutes to check them. But now I kind of regret that I didn&rsquo;t do much editing during those 15 minutes. Perhaps my mental resources were depleted at that point?</p><p>In Task 1, I planned the report in roughly 5 minutes and wrote it in 15 minutes. In Task 2, I planned for 8 minutes and wrote the essay in 17 minutes.</p><p>Part of the reason why I could write so fast is that my average typing speed is nearly 90 words per minute. That&rsquo;s immensely useful. I believe everyone should
<a href=/t/young/ rel=noopener class=internal-link data-src=/t/young/>learn to touch-type</a>. It&rsquo;s a valuable skill.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Task 1</strong>: The graph below gives information about the price of bananas in four countries between 1994 and 2004.</p></li><li><p><strong>My performance</strong>: 271 words</p></li><li><p><strong>Predicted score</strong>: 9.0</p></li><li><p><strong>Task 2</strong>: Some people believe that women should play an equal role as men in a country&rsquo;s police force or military force, such as the army. Others think women are not suitable for these kinds of jobs. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.</p></li><li><p><strong>My performance</strong>: 317 words</p></li><li><p><strong>Predicted score</strong>: 9.0</p></li></ul><p>My attempt to reproduce the essay (pretty sure it&rsquo;s 100% the same):</p><blockquote><p>Opinions are divided on whether women should play an equal role to that of men in the police and military forces of a country. I believe that while there are certainly tasks that can be performed by women in these organizations, forcing equality in terms of roles to play is simply not practical.</p><p>On the one hand, women can certainly be active members in a country&rsquo;s armed forces. In the army, for example, they can be trained to become doctors and nurses, as they tend to be more gentle and resiliant. And certainly they can fight as hard as any man in times of crises, such as during the current war against Russian invasion in Ukraine, where young men and women alike are both ready to volunteer to battle. Other examples can be found in the police. Although people often associate it with fighting crimes and maintaining public security, there are situations that are better dealt with by a woman, such as helping to calm a person in distress, who has undergone a traumatic event.</p><p>However, insisting that women should take on the same role as their male counterparts is a stretch. Evidence for this can be found in military training. Due to biological differences, women are simply incapable of carrying out tasks that most men can, for instance carrying 70-100kg of weapons and other equipment. If they are enlisted anyway, they may prove to be a liability. With regard to women in the police force, one is not hard-pressed to find footage on Youtube showing female police officers failing to pursue or restrain a suspect, thereby posing a threat to the public, as well as the incumbent officers.</p><p>In conclusion, although gender equality is desired in various aspects of life and fields of profession, I do not agree that women can take on the same responsibilities as men in highly specialized circumstances as mentioned above.</p></blockquote><p>(317 words)</p><p>Now, just for fun, here are my own comments on the essay:</p><ul><li>I misspelled &ldquo;resilient&rdquo;.</li><li>The word &ldquo;incumbent&rdquo; is definitely unnatural. I made a mistake I always tell my students to avoid: <em>Do not use a word you&rsquo;re not sure how to use in the test.</em></li><li>I think I risked contradicting myself when I wrote &ldquo;they can fight as hard as any man&rdquo;, though to be fair I did the phrase &ldquo;in times of crises&rdquo; to avoid over-generalization.</li><li>There are several parts I should have done differently. For example, I should have worded &ldquo;biological differences&rdquo; more specifically and written &ldquo;thereby putting the public and the officers themselves in danger&rdquo;, among others.</li><li>I also suspect that I haven&rsquo;t elaborated quite enough. In the second body paragraph I should have added one more sentence as a conclusion.</li></ul><p>I handed the essay to a colleague and here&rsquo;s his feedback (which I love):</p><ul><li>&ldquo;Incumbent officers&rdquo; is weird phrasing (confirmed!)</li><li>The second paragraph is weaker. (This is interesting because I myself think the first one is weaker.)</li><li>&ldquo;is a stretch&rdquo; could have been better phrased, perhaps &ldquo;impractical&rdquo; or &ldquo;counterproductive simply for the sake of artificial diversity&rdquo;.</li><li>&ldquo;fields of profession&rdquo; is weird (Though I was reassured by a quick Google search—Perhaps it has also been used by some goofball like me?)</li><li>Maybe you jumped into examples too quickly instead of elaborating on the general concept first.</li></ul><p>Here&rsquo;s a paragraph he wrote—an excellent piece, clearly worthy of a 9.</p><blockquote><p>Though it is preferable to have equal representation, female presence in the military should be encouraged, but never enforced through political means. Military has always historically been a male dominated profession, with women being only an insignificant minority. Even then, they were often delegated to non-combative roles – taking up the roles of medical support or left to handling logistics. The same could be said for women in the police force, as many hand-on duties (Patrolling or arresting) are more often than not, left completely in the hand of their male colleagues. The historical precedent for this is a simple one. Men are, by biological design, physically larger and stronger than their female counterpart, so are seen as more capable of handling tasks that require physical confrontation.</p></blockquote><p>To be honest I&rsquo;m being too optimistic about my writing scores, but hey a man has hopes. 😁</p><a href=#speaking><h3 id=speaking>Speaking</h3></a><p>My answer to Part 2 was cut off when I hadn&rsquo;t reached the juicy part yet and that makes me a little unsure about my performance. The rest of the test was fine, I guess. I did pay attention to the length of my answers, but most of the time I read the examiner&rsquo;s facial cues to determine whether I should continue speaking or just finish my response. Let&rsquo;s see how it would turn out.</p><ul><li><strong>Part 1</strong>: Work, Email, Cinema</li><li><strong>Part 2</strong>: A New Place</li><li><strong>My performance</strong>: Not as good as I expected and I was quite nervous at the beginning</li><li><strong>Predicted score</strong>: Perhaps the same as 8 years ago (8.5)?</li></ul><a href=#results><h2 id=results>Results</h2></a><p>I received the results on May 26. Here it is.</p><p><img src=/images/ielts-bc-2022-05-26.png alt></p><p>Quite a disillusionment, to be honest. 😅 I thought my writing answers were very good, but oh well, apparently there&rsquo;s still much room for improvement, which is good. I knew my speaking performance was kind of meh, so 8.0 was fair, I suppose.</p><p>Anyway, the wait is over, and I&rsquo;ve learned quite a few lessons from the experience. The next step would be to use these lessons to improve the courses I&rsquo;m developing.</p><p>Until next time!</p></article><hr><div class=page-end><div class=backlinks-container><h3>Backlinks</h3><ul class=backlinks><li><a href=/m/cv/ data-ctx="IELTS 8.5" data-src=/m/cv class=internal-link>Résumé</a></li></ul></div><div><script src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@6.7.0/dist/d3.min.js integrity="sha256-+7jaYCp29O1JusNWHaYtgUn6EhuP0VaFuswhNV06MyI=" crossorigin=anonymous></script><h3>Interactive Graph</h3><div id=graph-container></div><style>:root{--g-node:var(--secondary);--g-node-active:var(--primary);--g-node-inactive:var(--visited);--g-link:var(--outlinegray);--g-link-active:#5a7282}</style><script src=https://dangquang.xyz/js/graph.0eb0c81d58a703569f31b6053242af38.js></script></div></div><div id=contact_buttons><footer><p>Made by Nguyễn Đăng Quang using <a href=https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz>Quartz</a>, © 2022</p><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li></ul></footer></div></div></body></html>
