There was a time when I was determined to read 52 books a year, one every week. Then I changed my mind, believing that quality trumps quantity. With the conviction, I read less and less, all the while telling myself that if I was to read a book, I would have to have a long time-block, some quietude, and a note-taking app. But, as it often turns out, I got drawn to doing the everyday chores and work-related tasks, and thus rarely got round to doing any serious reading. The resulting piecemeal approach to reading a book wasn't particularly helpful either.

I don't feel that guilty, but I do realize now, that I was at my best when I read books regularlyâ€”when I let the little world of mine collide with others', producing what I like to call "sparked notes", new ideas blazing as they enter the atmosphere of my own planet.

So I made what Cal Newport calls a "grand gesture", to once again embark on my reading journey: I bought the new Kobo Libra!

(Shh... I know. It's just a fancy excuse to finally lay my fingers on this gorgeous ereader. Don't tell my wife.)

P.S. Ironically, it is the Libra that will accompany me. Dear [Kindles](t/kindle), thank you for changing my life for the past 10 years. I'll always cherish the time we had together.
