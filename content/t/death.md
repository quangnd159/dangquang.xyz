It's easy to say "Everyone dies" in passing. But if you lie in bed in a quiet night contemplating it, it's scary. It sends a chill down my pine. That thought. No, that reality. That one day I'll stop breathing. I cease to exist. This brain no longer has thoughts. These eyes no longer see. I'm erased. Forever. What will happen to humanity I'll never know. This Quang'll be nobody, just like billions that have gone before me. Nameless. And there's no afterlife.

When you think about your own mortality, you understand why people like to believe there's an afterlifeâ€”it provides some comfort. It soothes the fear.
