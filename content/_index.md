The name's Quang. I'm living in Binh Chanh, HCMC, with my wife and two sons 👶. In my free time I like learning stuff, [thinking](tags/thoughts), [writing](/tags), reading [books](p/highlights) on my beloved [Kindle](t/kindle), [drawing](m/drawing), and tinkering with my life.

🏠 This site is my fourth attempt at developing an online presence. Now that I've settled on storing my notes in plain text files, this is perhaps my permanent digital home (fomerly `dqnotes.com`).

🎬 Here's my (somewhat active) Youtube channel: [dangquang🌱](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHp8yAjMRmiPY9wnnW2GQQ). Also this one, [DQEnglish](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperEnglishbird), when I was young and wild.

✍️ I wrote IELTS-related stuff [here](https://ielts.dangquang.xyz).

🔨 I'm working on an IELTS study tool called [That IELTS Guide](https://thatieltsguide.com) for my students.

📋 And here's my [[m/cv|CV]].

## Students' Corner 🪴

If you're one of my IELTS students and are told to visit this place for some stuff, here it is.

- [Dicty for iOS](p/dicty.md)
- [GoldenDict for Windows, macOS and Android](p/goldendict.md)
- [Accelerate your language learning with SRS (Vietnamese)](p/srs.md)
- [My IELTS Notes](https://ielts.dangquang.xyz)

## What I'm doing now ⌛️

Building IELTS Writing and Speaking courses at [English House](https://ehc.edu.vn/).

Sometimes, on the spur of the moment, I resume my attempt to learn `JavaScript`. Here's a [paragraph planner](https://planner.thatieltsguide.com) web app I made in a fun weekend project.

Teaching myself [Chinese](/c/learnchinese). Right now I'm working on my listening skill with 小猪佩奇 (Peppa Pig).
