The name's Quang. I'm living in Binh Chanh, HCMC, with my wife and two sons 👶. In my free time I like learning stuff, [thinking](tags/thoughts), [writing](/tags), reading books, [drawing](m/drawing), and tinkering with my life.

🏠 This site is my third or fourth attempt at developing an online presence. Now that I've settled on storing my notes in text files, this is perhaps my permanent digital home. (The old name is `dqnotes.com`.)

🎬 Here's my (somewhat active) [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHp8yAjMRmiPY9wnnW2GQQ). And [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperEnglishbird) when I was young and wild.

✍️ I wrote (and intend to write more) about IELTS on [ai-eo.com](https://ai-eo.com) in Vietnamese.

🔨 I just made an IELTS study tool for my students at [thatieltsguide.com](https://thatieltsguide.com).

📋 And here's my [[m/cv|résumé]].

## Students' Corner 🪴

If you're one of my IELTS students and are told to visit this place for some stuff, here it is.

- [[p/dicty|Dicty for iOS]]
- [[p/goldendict|GoldenDict for Windows, macOS and Android]]
- [[p/srs|Accelerate your language learning with SRS (Vietnamese)]]

## What I'm doing now ⌛️

Building IELTS Writing and Speaking courses at [English House](https://ehc.edu.vn/).

Teaching myself [Chinese](/c/learnchinese). Right now I'm working on my listening skill with 小猪佩奇 (Peppa Pig).
