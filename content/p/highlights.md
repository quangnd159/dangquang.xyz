"For we are mistaken when we look forward to [death](t/death); the major portion of death has already passed. Whatever years be behind us are in death’s hands." —_Lucius Annaeus Seneca, Richard Mott Gummere (Translator), Seneca's Letters From a Stoic_

"Our egos are constructed in our formative years—our first two decades. They get constructed by our environment, our parents, society. Then, we spend the rest of our life trying to make our ego happy. We interpret anything new through our ego: “How do I change the external world to make it more how I would like it to be?”" —_Eric Jorgenson, Jack Butcher, and Tim Ferriss, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant_

"We often fail to allow for the possibility that evidence that should be critical to our judgment is missing—what we see is all there is." —_Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow_

"You’re born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations (lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. How you choose to interpret them is up to you—you have that choice." —_Eric Jorgenson, Jack Butcher, and Tim Ferriss, The Almanack of Naval Ravikant_

"At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children." —_Benjamin Franklin and Charles William Eliot, The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin_

"Sadly, human beings are in fact the only species that will deliberately deprive themselves of sleep without legitimate gain." —_Matthew Walker, Why We Sleep_

"His capacity for self-discipline is so large that it is almost funny. For example, he was a bit shocked when the Olympic basketball staff advised the Olympic basketball players to put in one hour of practice a day during the summer, because he was already putting in two hours a day—often in ninety-five-degree temperatures, with his feet squishing in sneakers that had become so wet that he sometimes skidded and crashed to the floor. His creed, which he picked up from Ed Macauley, is “When you are not practicing, remember, someone somewhere is practicing, and when you meet him he will win.”" —_John McPhee, A Sense of Where You Are_

"Every angel is an asshole somewhere. Every asshole is an angel somewhere." —_Nassim Nicholas Taleb, The Bed of Procrustes_
