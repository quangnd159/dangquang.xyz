I waited nearly 80 days for my breakdown, so be patient. I believe these organizations store our information for at least 2 years. This means you can still request your data if you took the test last year.

P.S. I learned to do this from several posts on Facebook and made some corrections e.g. "confirm my identification" should be "confirm my identity".
