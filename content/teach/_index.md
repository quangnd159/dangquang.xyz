title: My Notes on Teaching 🍎
description: Here live my notes on teaching English - my knowledge of it, my opinions on its different aspects, my learning about it, and my experiments with it. I believe that every teacher should be a practitioner, a tinkerer, one that won't stop learning, unlearning, and relearning the craft. Because at the end of the day, whatever we teach, it's all about making other lives a little better.
