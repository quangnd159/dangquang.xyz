Today (22 May 2022) I did my third IELTS exam (the first computer-delivered one). I took the test in 2014 (2nd time) at IDP and got 8.0 overall (L8, R8, W7, S8.5).

## Preparation

This time I had 20 days to prepare for the test. I did 3 listening tests online (scores ranging from 7-9) and 1-2 reading tests (8-9). Almost no prep for speaking though I did talk to myself a lot (as usual). However, I did tons of reading for the writing part: reading and analyzing high-level essays (I learned quite a lot from this.)

## The test

- **Test date**: 22 May 2022
- **Location**: British Council (Viettel Complex Building 285 CMT8)
- **Mode**: Computer-Delivered üñ•

### Listening

I got a little distracted in Part 2 and Part 3 where there are multiple choice and matching questions. IELTS Listening is funny. You zone out for a second and boom! you've missed an answer. This happened to me because the first two answers of the question set are put too close to one another in the recording.

It's important to stay calm even when you've missed an answer and pay attention on the next signpost. Losing one answer is fine. You can go back to it at the end of that section to make an educated guess.

- **Part 1**: Conversation between two friends about a job vacancy (waiter) at a restaurant
- **Part 2**: Radio talk about Lakeview Orchestra and its new program
- **Part 3**: Conversation between two students about their presentation on mercury contamination
- **Part 4**: A lecture of human perception of smell
- **My performance**: OK (missed one answer in Part 2 and had to guess based on what I thought I hadn‚Äôt heard) and 2 other answers I‚Äôm not 100% certain.
- **Expected score**: 8.0-8.5 (if I'm lucky)

### Reading

I think I nailed this one. Not very hard. No matching headings. The highlighting function is definitely helpful. For reading, it's important that we know which question types follow the same order as the information in the text. That helps a lot. Probably one of the reasons why I could complete the test 13 minutes early.

- **Passage 1**: Curran Judith - Documentary Film Maker
- **Passage 2**: Being left-handed in a right-handed world
- **Passage 3**: Honeybees in trouble - can native bees fill the gap?
- **My performance**: Good (had 13 minutes left to review every answer)
- **Expected score**: 9.0

### Writing

I completed both tasks in 45 minutes and had 15 minutes to check them. But now I kind of regret that I didn't do much editing during those 15 minutes. Perhaps my mental resources were depleted at that point?

In Task 1, I planned the report in roughly 5 minutes and wrote it in 15 minutes. In Task 2, I planned for 8 minutes and wrote the essay in 17 minutes.

Part of the reason why I could write so fast is that my average typing speed is nearly 90 words per minute. That's immensely hugeful. I believe everyone should [learn to touch-type](/t/young.md). It's a valuable skill.

- **Task 1**: The graph below gives information about the price of bananas in four countries between 1994 and 2004.
- **My performance**: 271 words
- **Expected score**: 9.0

- **Task 2**: Some people believe that women should play an equal role as men in a country's police force or military force, such as the army. Others think women are not suitable for these kinds of jobs. Discuss both these views and give your opinion.
- **My performance**: 317 words
- **Expected score**: 9.0

To be honest I'm being too optimistic about my writing scores, but hey a man has hopes. üòÅ

### Speaking

My answer to Part 2 was cut off when I hadn't reached the juicy part yet and that makes me a little unsure about my performance. The rest of the test was fine, I guess. I did pay attention to the length of my answers, but most of the time I read the examiner's facial cues to determine whether I should continue speaking or just finish my response. Let's see how it would turn out.

- **Part 1**: Work, Email, Cinema
- **Part 2**: A New Place
- **My performance**: Not as good as I expected and I was quite nervous at the beginning
- **Expected score**: Perhaps the same as 8 years ago (8.5)?
