And if you were taken aback, it means you may not have fully explored all the meanings of boobs (they‚Äôre not just men‚Äôs hopes and dreams.) Today you'll learn a boob means a stupid mistake, it also means a stupid person, and heck it can be a verb and mean to make a stupid mistake. These meanings even came before a woman‚Äôs breast: in fact, they date back to the 16th century.\n\nI had known only one meaning of the word boob until I read On Writing Well by William Zinsser. I mean, if this word is used in a heavily edited book by one of the best non-fiction writers in the United States, I‚Äôm all in. But let us first enjoy some of the uses of the word. They are hilarious.\n\nThe government once again has made a big boob. (Collins COBUILD)\n\nThe big boob doesn‚Äôt know enough to come in out of the rain. (Webster‚Äôs)\n\nForgetting the President‚Äôs name was a bit of a boob. (This one has music in it, Oxford Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary)\n\nHe boobed rather badly by getting her name wrong. (Cambridge Advanced Learner‚Äôs Dictionary)\n\nAlso, try replacing ‚Äúsilly mistakes‚Äù with ‚Äúboobs‚Äù in quotes. Here‚Äôs my favorite: Do you ever make boobs? It is one of my very few creative activities. ‚Äî Len Deighton.\n\nSomeday in my writing lessons, I‚Äôll give my students handouts that ask them to identify boobs in an essay. Or I‚Äôll encourage them to talk in my speaking lessons with the timeless advice: It is okay to boob. But I digress.\n\nAfter 29 years, I‚Äôm still an incredibly big boob. Some boobs I make once. But some tend to persist. In this blog post, I‚Äôd like introspect and grab three of my biggest boobs.\n\nBoob number 1 ‚Äî I don‚Äôt follow through (or do but very late). I can‚Äôt tell how many times I‚Äôve failed people and myself by going back on promises. These range from deadlines at work to my own goals, both those I keep to myself and those I announce to the world (which itself is another boob.) Breaking a promise is the fastest way to destroy integrity and reliability. I should be grateful that so many people in my life have been gracefully tolerant towards this boob of mine and have been willing to give me a second chance, and third, and fourth. Not following through is also an efficient way to squander my life, all previous effort and time gone. Seth Godin says you either make it to the other side or just quit before you start. Also, if you happen to read Daily Rituals by Curry Mason, you‚Äôll see that titans in different fields are masters of self-discipline. They can be boobs in this or that, but when it comes to grinding, no one can hold a candle to them. I don't have a plan to become a titan, but this is a boob that I must rectify, and do so quick unless I want to lie in my deathbed leaving behind a life wasted on a ton of undone businesses.\n\nBoob number 2 ‚Äî I give my opinions on social media. I used to be a fervent social media user. I posted stuff and made remarks, very often passing judgment like I was a paragon of virtue. Gradually I tend to believe that using social networks like Facebook is a rather huge boob too, because it allows me to judge easily. In real life it‚Äôs hard to say something mean to someone when I can tell from their face that they are hurt. Online, conscience doesn‚Äôt gnaw that hard. So I‚Äôve learned a tactic to avoid making boobs on social networks. Whenever I am about to ejaculate something on the inter-web, I ask myself 3 questions and often end up not saying anything at all: (1) Does what I'm going to say do any good? (2) Is what I say well informed or merely reactive? and (3) Does it make any difference whether I say it or not? (Hint: most of the time it doesn‚Äôt.)\n\nBoob number 3 ‚Äî I give unsolicited advice. I feel good when I can give timely advice, but it's a boob to give advice when not asked for. It's simply presumptuous and no one likes a smart alec. I once or twice jumped into others‚Äô inbox just to give them advice because they shared some problem on their Facebook timeline. That‚Äôs when we say I ‚Äúboobed rather badly.‚Äù Fortunately most people are polite enough to say thanks to the \"bestowed wisdom\", but please just keep it to yourself, Quang.\n\nTo boob or not to boob? I say to boob. However, distinction must be made between boobs that help me grow as a person and boobs that do a disservice to others. I have a fair share of the latter, and I am terribly sorry. Now I may look like I‚Äôm going to make boob number 1 when I say this, but I promise I will try to make fewer boobs that hurt others, especially those I truly care about.","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.429817245Z","tags":null},"/notes/cv":{"title":"üìã R√©sum√©","content":"## Contact information\n\n- Name: Nguy·ªÖn ƒêƒÉng Quang\n- Address: 13B Nguyen Van Linh, Phong Phu, Binh Chanh, HCMC, Vietnam\n- Mobile: (+84) 909 332 601\n- Email: quangnd159@gmail.com\n- Website dqnotes.com | ai-eo.com\n\n## Interests\n\n- Languages, books, writing, digital painting, graphic design, personal knowledge management, programming languages\n\n## Experience and qualifications\n\n- Teaching and developing IELTS courses at [English House](https://ehc.edu.vn/) (2020 to present)\n\n- Taught English at HCMC University of Education ‚Äì FLC Branch 2, primarily teaching TOEFL, IELTS, TOEIC and Conversation classes (2012 to 2016)\n\n- Worked as a program officer at SEAMEO Regional Center for Lifelong Learning (2014 to 2016)\n\n- Taught IELTS programs at YOLA (2016 to 2020)\n\n- Facilitated a practicum program for TEFL trainees at YOLA in cooperation with CIEE in 2016 and 2017\n\n- Made instructional videos on YouTube at https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperEnglishbird\n\n- Designed logos, banners, standees, backdrops for HCMC University of Education ‚Äì FLC Branch 2 and SEAMEO Regional Center for Lifelong Learning\n\n- Produced infographics for an international project ‚ÄúTowards a Lifelong Learning Agenda in Southeast Asian Countries‚Äù\n\n- IELTS 8.0 (2014)\n\n## Education\n\n- Bachelor‚Äôs degree in English Language Teaching at HCMC University of Education (2008-2012)\n\n- Master‚Äôs degree in Applied Linguistics at Curtin University (2013-2014)","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.429817245Z","tags":null},"/notes/drawing":{"title":"My drawing","content":"{{\u003c image-gallery gallery_dir=\"album\" \u003e}}","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.429817245Z","tags":null},"/notes/dudevsman":{"title":"Dude vs. Man","content":"\u003e Drax the Destroyer: He is not a dude.

A handsome, muscular man.  \n\u003e Avengers: Infinity War (2018)  \n\u003e Yes, I‚Äôm a dude, English-teaching-wise, who liked to think he was a man, a handsome, muscular man, English-teaching-wise of course.\n\nDrax‚Äôs line cracked us up. But this is my wake-up call story. I hit my OK plateau. According to author Joshua Foer in his bestselling Moonwalking with Einstein, we reach the OK plateau in our job when our skill is good enough‚Äîwhen we start to put things on autopilot and get along just fine. Want me to teach an IELTS reading lesson? Sure! Want me to teach a TOEFL writing class? Piece of cake! With my years of experience, I can just walk in there and breeze through the whole thing, impromptu. Laurence Endersen, in his book *Pebbles of Perception: How a Few Good Choices Make All the Difference*, argues that in any process of skill development a person goes from ignorance to conversational level to operational level to proficiency to mastery. Many are operational. It‚Äôs like when we learn to drive a car: we‚Äôre happy as long as we can operate a 1.4-ton machine to take us from A to B. Proficient is when we can reverse parallel park it into a tiny little slot. Mastery is when we can perform physics-defying s\\*%t in the Fast \u0026 Furious series (Don‚Äôt try!) I thought I was proficient, well, until last February.\n\nI was on an 8-hour ride home that day when I received an email from the Academic Director. It was my annual performance report, much like one that my students, or more precisely their parents, receive at the end of a course. And man it was horrible. Disheartening. Perhaps my scores in previous years had not been better than that; it‚Äôs just one of those moments when you‚Äôre on a coach taking stock of your life that you tend to be more open to fundamental questions of who you are and what your legacy will be. The scores were embarrassingly low, some of them below average. The Net Promotion Score was so low I felt like the world hated me. If truth be told, I took the hit with indignation. I swear I worked hard as a teacher. I took my job seriously. And honestly who doesn‚Äôt? At the risk of sounding grandiose, anyone who has answered to this calling of imparting knowledge to next generations does not take it lightly. Every teacher is dedicated. Every teacher spends the bulk of their time every day preparing lessons with a single purpose in mind: the students improve! So hurt I was. I had good intention, but turned out many of my students didn‚Äôt even like to study with me.\n\nThe second email on that fateful day also came from the Academic Director: Scores of the Top Teachers. I tapped on it. Loaded. Holy moly! 20 of them, with shining figures. Who are these? Aliens?\n\nLater a colleague gave me a pat on the back, saying ‚ÄúWell, scores are not everything, you know.‚Äù It was funny because I often found myself saying exactly the same thing to my students. Scores are indeed not everything, but they do say something. If my teaching performance scores are so low, something is seriously wrong with my current practices. And if my colleagues‚Äô scores are so high, something is seriously right with their practices.\n\nNot long after the emails I inboxed my line Academic Manager to ask her whether she could pull off a workshop in which the top performers share their best practices. That was not possible. She instead suggested I observe one from the top list and fortunately for me he happened to be around the very top. Of course I said yes.\n\nAfter some quick arrangement I finally got to observe one of the top teachers at the school. It was, to put it mildly, mind-blowing! And to quote myself from a follow-up email I sent him 2 days later, it was amazing: three hours of review but he orchestrated the whole thing with grace and flair. He sure knows how to interact with his students and how to slice up IELTS knowledge into digestible bite-size pieces. That, along with his ability to weave personal stories into the lesson, really makes it stick. You guys know that little psychological trick when communicating with a child? The ‚Äúlowering yourself to be at eye level‚Äù stuff? This man sat on the floor! He made his young charges feel confident and respected. The amazing thing is that in our follow-up session when I mentioned the mnemonic devices he used and the psychological trick he deployed, he said he wasn‚Äôt even aware that he was using those techniques. That was a moment of revelation: what novices see as technicality are intuitive to masters. This man is a master.\n\nHow did I survive this long? Was it just some of my good presentations I did when I first worked here? Was it all a Halo Effect?\n\nI will not bore you to death with details here, so suffice it to say I was putting my teaching on autopilot and thought it was good enough. I was only operational. I was not uncomfortable. Hint: ‚ÄòIf you‚Äôre not uncomfortable, then you‚Äôre probably stuck at an ‚Äúacceptable level‚Äù‚Äô (Cal Newport, So Good They Can‚Äôt Ignore You.)\nSapere Aude. I place this Latin proverb in the front of my little home library. It means Dare to Know. First used by Horace in 20 BC, the full phrase is ‚ÄúHe who has begun is half done; dare to know; begin!‚Äù\n\nI want my students to dare to know, but I‚Äôve learned that as a teacher I must dare to know too. I must dare to know my own weaknesses and limitations. I must dare to face them. I must dare to tell my students that yes I do have tons of shortcomings and yet I dare to improve. ‚ÄúAs a man thinketh in his heart, so shall he be,‚Äù said James Allen in my favorite book As a Man Thinketh. In my heart I want to be a better teacher, so shall I be.\n\nI hope my personal story accentuates two important values: integrity and transparency. These are also the values I wish to see in my children. Indeed we name our son after Benjamin Franklin for good reasons. This founding father of the United States later in his life ‚Äúgrew convinc‚Äôd that truth, sincerity and integrity in dealings between man and man were of the utmost importance to the felicity of life‚Äù. Very often it‚Äôs good to get slapped right across the face. Very good, indeed, as our ability to ignore our ignorance is hilariously unfailing, observed Daniel Kahneman in his bestseller Thinking: Fast and Slow. In fact, I sensed something was wrong with my teaching back in 2018 when a master teacher came to visit my class and told me my lesson lacked variety. I took it to heart and have been trying to fix it ever since. Observing The Man, I knew I need to go back to the basics and work from there. As my man Marcus Aurelius wrote in his diary nearly 2000 years ago: ‚ÄúNo random actions, none not based on underlying principles.‚Äù\n\nThis is how I live and work with the school's core values.

But can I be you? The thing is, if I really am you, I would do the same thing you‚Äôd do originally and that renders my advice redundant. If, on the other hand, the advice is based on my experience, I would not be you in the first place.\n\nAnd mind you, most of the time people don‚Äôt need advice. More common purposes are seeking confirmation, permission, or moral support. Unsolicited advice, therefore, is the worst: it inadvertently undermines the agency of the unfortunate receiver. On the giver‚Äôs side, the act itself actually gratifies our deep desire for power, a sense of superiority. That partly explains why we love to counsel.\n\nGiving and receiving advice turns out to be a wacko transaction peculiar to a species called homo sapiens.\n\nSpeaking of superiority, I‚Äôd often find myself saying this: if I were in his shoes, I certainly wouldn‚Äôt have done that. Saying that is a boob, and the person saying that is yet a bigger boob. I‚Äôve learned that putting myself in someone else‚Äôs shoes goes to an extent far beyond some specific circumstances.\n\nWhat does it really mean to say if I were in his shoes?\n\nIt means to be born and raised by the same parents (or to have no parents at all), nudged here and there through life by the same concatenation of random events, and dictated by the same chemical reactions in the brain, triggered when a certain situation arises, to name but a few. In other words, we don‚Äôt know diddly-squat about what it‚Äôs like to be others.\n\n\u003e Nobody is superior, nobody is inferior, but nobody is equal either. People are simply unique, incomparable. You are you, I am I.\n\u003e\n\u003e \u003ccite\u003eOsho\u003c/cite\u003e\n\nWe perceive the reality differently. We never see the same apple: its color and connotation depend on how our brains are wired and whence we come. There is no sameness when it comes to human experience. There will always be nuances, and perhaps more correctly, oceans of discrepancy in the ways we see things. Indeed, our image of the outside world is filtered through lenses crystallized from years of personal experiences, distorted by culturally formed biases, and physically influenced by innate nervous wiring.\n\nIn this light, I think it‚Äôs funny how we‚Äôre so naturally prone to condemn others, especially on social media where we barely know each other and are ignorant of the full context.\n\nAt the end of the day, is it not a blessed relief not having to see eye to eye with everyone on everything? A better use of our eyes, perhaps, is seeing and acknowledging others as distinct individuals. True, down right to the atomic level we‚Äôre exactly the same, yet each hominid bundle of atoms constructs an entity that‚Äôs like no other. Accept just that, and we may be free.","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.429817245Z","tags":null},"/notes/finally30":{"title":"Finally 30","content":"Today I've officially lived 30 years on what Carl Sagan called a pale blue dot. Hence this piece of writing where I will jot down a few thoughts. (Almost no polishing applied, apologies. Also, swearing here and there.)\n\nI thought I'd write a piece about gratitude, to all the people that have made me who I am today. But that piece would be overwhelmingly long and of little use to whoever happens to read this. And about attitude, Tom Rath taught me a thing or two in his little book It's Not About You: if you are grateful to someone, tell them all that in person before it is too late.\n\nBut honestly, thank you Mom and Dad. Thanks for taming the beast in me. Deep inside, I know I'd have turned into a friggin sociopath without you guys.\nIt's generally agreed that the age of full maturity, at least as far as brains go, is 25. I'm always that guy who's slower than others, so I'd say mine is 30. I can't believe I'm saying this now, but I am mature.\n\nMaturity is a long process. There are no one single point at which you become mature. For me, there are several mind shifts that led me to this point.\nThe first important mind shift was initiated by anh L√™ Minh Tr√≠, an incredible classmate during my university years.\n\nIt was just another normal day when I was sitting on a bench, just beside block C, at my university. He would as usual approach me out of nowhere, but on that day, he had a question for me.\n\nHe asked: \"Hey Quang, how many books do you read a year?\"\n\nPerhaps on that very same day I was having an existential crisis, because that should explain why I was shocked by such an innocent question. None. I didn't read any book at all.\n\nYou know that feeling when you were half way through a book everyone was crazy about and thought: \"I don't understand all the fuzz. This book is mediocre at best.\" Maybe that is true, but more often than not you were reading it at a wrong point in your life. Books that matter come to you at the right time.\n\nSo it's fair to say that Anh Tr√≠'s question came to me at the right time, rocking my world. I realized on that day that I was missing out in the world of knowledge and was living in shameful ignorance. Not long after the incident, I bought my first Kindle, from Anh Tri. Wait. Was it your sale tactic, Anh Tri? Hmm...\n\nAnyway, the advent of the Kindle introduced me to the world of the learned.\n\nThe second important mind shift: the scholar Nguy·ªÖn Hi·∫øn L√™.\n\nNguy·ªÖn Hi·∫øn L√™'s autobiography was one of the first ebooks I read on the Kindle. I'd never read such a long book before, but his prose kept me going and I finished the book in a few days.\n\nHis writing is humble, yet exquisite, using the kind of Vietnamese that was still in infancy, but extremely refined, one you may consider pure and pristine. He made me fall in love with the South, people and scenes. It was this love that pushed me to an extreme: anti-Communism. I was extremely negative and insurgent at the time. Had it not been for a wise man who happened to care about me, I don't know how far into the rabbit's hole (or gulag) I would have gone. (For those who are curious about my current take on politics: I no longer give a fuck.)\n\n![Nguyen Hien Le excerpt](/../assets/ess-nguyen-hien-le-trich-doan.png \"Book Excerpt\")\n\nThe book's chapter on his working routine led me to Nguyen Hien Le's another famous book: T·ª± h·ªçc. This coincided with my employment at SEAMEO Regional Centre for Lifelong Learning. These events fueled my passion for learning and my conviction about its crucial role in anyone's success in this century. I mean, one way or another, everyone learns their entire life, but once you are aware of its power and commit to it, you're not only helping yourself, you're doing people around you a great service.\n\nMy third book by Nguyen Hien Le was Confucius Analects, bringing me into the world of philosophy. From there, I explored a bit further and eventually found the philosophy of my life.\n\nThe third, and most, important mind shift: Stoicism\n\nI don't remember exactly when I learned about Stoicism. It was probably in 2017, the year I read my first Stoic book ‚Äì On the Shortness of Life by Seneca. Stoicism immediately hit me as my life philosophy, one that would guide me towards being a better person and a much more meaningful life.\n\n![Aurelius quote](/../assets/ess-marcus-aurelius-quote.png \"Aurelius quote\")\n\nAgain, I want to emphasize that Stoicism must have come to me at the right time. I'm convinced that most young people will find it hard to believe (and accept) that there are things you have no control over whatsoever, and that we face our mortality every day. If I had been introduced to Stoicism when I was in the second year of college? Nah. I was the epitome of everything immature back then.\n\nNow, getting the red light at every intersection along a long-ass road no longer angers me. Torrential rain when I'm riding home late in the evening? It's all right. In fact, I rather enjoy it and sometimes I would sing. People think I'm bullshit? If that hurts me, it's not the opinion that hurts, but rather my own judgement of such opinion, and I have the power to discard it and look inward.\n\nBut perhaps the most important thing of all is the fact that I've fully adopted the cosmic perspective, that \"the whole earth is a mere point in space\" (Marcus Aurelius), that our arguments with strangers on the internet are fucking pointless use of time, considering the fact that the entire human history is just a few hours if the age of the universe is packed into an earth year.\n\nI remember when I was little I had a hard time grasping the concept of \"foreign countries\", like \"Whoa whoa there, what do you mean there are other countries beside Vietnam? My hometown isn't all there is?\" Yes, I was a complete imbecile. Geez. Now, I think many people, no matter how old they are, tend to live with that kind of mindset - experiencing the world from a limited perspective of an individual - as if their world is all there is.\n\nI think maturity is the understanding and acceptance that people are idiosyncratic and different. I think we can claim to be mature when we stop having that false sense of superiority, when we realize that we're all in this together, when we know love is the most important thing in life, and when we finally realize that \"It's about me, but it's not about me.\" (Quang, 2020)\n\nNow that my first 30 years of life are in death's hand and I have no idea what the future holds in store for me, there is no promise. But there is a commitment. A commitment to being useful.\n\nSai Gon, 15/9/2020","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.433817235Z","tags":null},"/notes/kindle":{"title":"The Joy of Reading on the Kindle","content":"The Kindle is a blessing.\n\nWhenever I tell someone that I love reading on the Kindle, the usual response is \"I prefer paper books because I can feel the page and enjoy the pleasing scent of real paper.\" They're simply missing the point: there is no comparison inherent between ebooks and paperbooks. The ereader is not created to replace paperbooks, as the latter has achieved its perfect form. This is not a case of reinventing the wheel. In fact, it is more of a wheel versus maglev situation. They are just different.\n\nIn the final analysis, however, aren't we all reading the same book? My six-year-old niece listened to Harry Potter audiobooks. I read them on my Kindle. We later had an awesome conversation about Harry and his adventures, recalling the same details. I don't hear people say \"Well, Stephen Fry's narration is legendary and all, but I prefer paperbooks because I love the voice in my head when I read one.\"\n\nNow, a Kindle can hold many books. My Kindle Paperwhite has a storage of 8 gigabytes and thus can hold up to 6000 books, more than what I can read over a lifetime. Let's say a person reads from the age of 7 nonstop, one book a week, to 80. That's 3,276 books.\n\n![Kindles](/../assets/my-kindles.jpeg \"Kindles\")\n\nHow do I get books on my Kindle? That's easy. I have the world's library at my fingertip ‚Äî the Amazon Kindle Store. There I can essentially buy 99% of the items on my reading list, many cheaper than their physical counterparts. Just a few touches and there comes the book. We as millennials tend to take things for granted, but this is practically magic. A poor soul a hundred years ago could only learn to be patient.\n\nWith non-fiction books, I read and highlight, sometimes making notes. All those data will be synced to a service called Readwise. This web app turns all my highlights and notes into flashcards, and then sends about 6 random ones to my email every day for review. That way I make sure what I read will not be obliviated.\n\nWith fiction, a nice little feature allows me to immerse myself in the story: I can disable the touchscreen so that the only gesture I can make is swiping forward (or sometimes back), instead of looking up new words like an obsessive.\n\nBut the best thing about the Kindle is a technological wonder called font! I can use virtually any typeface, serif or san serif, with adjustable size and weight, line height, and margin.\nI used to buy lots of paperbooks and I learned this: not every book is created equal. Many unfortunate books are born having a grotesque appearance. Either the text is too small or too dense, or both. There may be hardly any space for avid practitioners of marginalia. Sometimes (gosh darn it!) the text is printed just ever so askew and I spend the rest of my life hating myself.\n\nOn my Kindle I tend to read most often with Bookerly, an Amazon exclusive font. Bookerly is a godsend.\n\nDid I tell you I have an 8-month-old baby? Now I should go ahead and establish a cult of parents who use one hand to read on the Kindle with young babies sleeping in their arms. Yes, that is me doing just that in the profile picture. Sometimes he sleeps like that for one hour and a half. He is well rested, and I am well read (pun indeed intended.)\n\nI had my first Kindle when I was still a junior, when Amazon was not so romantic as to give the Kindle cute epithets. Back then, page turning was still flashing and slow, but it was love at first sight all the same. I loved to read as a child when books were not easy to find ‚Äî I lived in a rather poor, rural area ‚Äî and I used to wait every week for my mother to bring home a children's magazine from her school. Now a teacher and a father of one, I am empowered by the Kindle.

The remnants of the old days become alive and kicking, kicking my heart the hardest: the scent, the sights, the ambience, the whole nine yards. Whenever I listen to this specific song in Vietnamese, I sorely miss my father and tears fill my eyes. This ability of music to trigger vivid memories can be attributed to our brain‚Äôs power of association. The more connections are made to a specific event, the more likely we store it permanently in our brain. Music is one of the strongest links because it has been incorporated into our DNA for millennia (The earliest known musical instruments date back 40,000 years!) Another strong link is provided by visual stimuli. I still remember managing to nail down a historical date or number in my history exams. The secret? I sort of recalled that it was printed somewhere in the top right corner of page 102. It‚Äôs spatial association.\n\nSo what happens when we meet old friends? We relive our old days, visiting our very own old self, or selves, in the process. With a group of friends, we can be reminded of events that (we think) no longer stay in our head. Together we are like the pieces of a whole puzzle, each helping one another illuminate parts of the past that have been shrouded by the inevitable fingers of time. Memories can fail us. We may remember something falsely or incompletely. We may even ‚Äúremember‚Äù something that never actually happened. Really. Some ingenuous people were convinced by psychologists that they had committed crimes! But old friends won‚Äôt. The collective memory is effective against such fallibility. It‚Äôs true that individual memories can be very different from collective memories, but old facts are more likely to remain facts.\n\nOn such occasions, associations come with a profound impact. Our friends‚Äôs faces, voice, laughters, and their fossilized gestures invoke sundry remembrances, fond and bitter. ‚ÄúGood gracious, I used to be like that,‚Äù think I. When a friend brings to the table something pleasant that everyone else still remembers, we all rejoice in reminiscence. We laugh. Some genuine laughters once in a while. ‚ÄúWhoa, wait a minute guys, our first meeting was like 14 years ago,‚Äù said I, in a wedding party just a week ago. Come to think of it, 14 years ago, it was these people with whom I spent the bulk of my time, almost every day. Isn't that something special? Seeing old friends really reminds me of how long I‚Äôve traversed the territory of life, how much has changed, how much I have changed, and how much I have been changed. Each time I see my old friends, I am given a chance to pay a visit to earlier me's, each different in its own time, each a point of departure for the next, and all of these me's make me me today. Seeing old friends is a form of time travel, a kind less confusing than, say, that in Avengers Endgame. The world is lost and here we are, in this cocoon of isolated time dimension, chatting away.\n\nTime surely has its corrosive effects on things, some reduced to nothingness. But the concatenation of nerve impulses allow me to, from time to time, remember a friend, some way back in primary school. I believe my friends do remember me, too, from time to time. I have this little conviction that every single person I meet in life, even for a fleeting moment, one way or another leaves an impact on my trajectory, a personal butterfly effect. These little impacts go a long way, nudging us here and there, and transform us. Yes our path diverges at some point, but hey, down the road, we will once again meet. Delighted as always.","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.433817235Z","tags":null},"/notes/silence":{"title":"The Importance of Being Silent","content":"we should all learn to be silent\n\nbecause it‚Äôs what we need\n\nthe silence to think\n\nthe silence to see things from different perspectives\n\nthe silence to understand opposite views\n\nthe silence to calm down\n\nthe silence to see if it‚Äôs worth giving an opinion at all\n\nthe silence to realize the person we‚Äôre arguing against is a real human being\n\nwith emotions\n\nnot mere words and symbols delivered to your screen by the internet\n\nthe silence to introspect\n\nto see how significant you are\n\nyet at the same time very small\n\npuny even\n\nthe silence to focus on your breath and let go of everything else\n\nthe silence to stop the noise from accumulating\n\nit‚Äôs too loud\n\nbut perhaps we‚Äôre already so used to it\n\nthe silence to, well, excuse my french, just shut the fuck up!\n\nwe don‚Äôt need to talk\n\nsometimes\n\nmost of the times\n\nlisten!\n\nyou may understand me\n\nand i you\n\nsocial media is constant, fast\n\nwe all want to catch up\n\nbut slow down!\n\ngoing fast only hurts our thinking\n\nand alters our behaviors in undesirable ways\n\nfake news, myths, false information\n\nthey spread like wildfire\n\ncascading from the cloud\n\nblinding our judgment\n\nmaking us vulnerable\n\nmaybe the silence to stop thinking at all\n\nto get in touch with reality\n\nto see things as they are\n\nto stop finding meaning behind little things\n\nto stop second guessing people\n\nthe silence to find home in your mom‚Äôs voice\n\nfrom a distance\n\nthe silence to lose yourself in your beloved‚Äôs embrace\n\nthe silence to watch your child play\n\nher pure joy palpable\n\nthe silence to have a walk in nature\n\nappreciating how life can be fragile\n\nthe air we breathe\n\nthe fragrance of wild flowers we no longer care to savor\n\nthe comfort of knowing we‚Äôre still walking on earth\n\nthe silence to admit\n\nall this\n\nall this may be gone now\n\nthe silence to be at peace\n\nthe silence to just be","lastmodified":"2022-04-06T06:38:45.433817235Z","tags":null}}
